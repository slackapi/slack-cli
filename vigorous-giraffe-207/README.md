# Bolt for JavaScript Template App

This is a generic Bolt for JavaScript template app used to build out Slack apps.

## Setup

Before getting started, make sure you have a development workspace where you have permissions to install apps. If you don't have one setup, go ahead and [create one](https://slack.com/create).

### Developer Program

Join the [Slack Developer Program](https://api.slack.com/developer-program) for exclusive access to sandbox environments for building and testing your apps, tooling, and resources created to help you build and grow.

### Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Other Coding Agents

Install the [Slack MCP and Skills Plugin](https://docs.slack.dev/ai/slack-skills-plugin/) so your coding agent can create, run, and deploy Slack apps, look up Web API methods and scopes, and build Block Kit without guessing.

#### Claude Code

Run this in a Claude Code session:

```
/plugin install slack@claude-plugins-official
```

#### Codex

Run this in your terminal:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add slackapi/slack-skills-plugin
codex plugin add slack@slack
```

#### Cursor

Run this in a Cursor Agent chat:

```
/add-plugin slack
```

#### Other agents

Install the skills with `npx skills`, using your [agent's identifier](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills#supported-agents):

```sh
npx skills add slackapi/slack-skills-plugin -y -a <agent>

# For example, OpenCode
npx skills add slackapi/slack-skills-plugin -y -a opencode
```

## Installation

<details><summary><strong>Using Slack CLI</strong></summary>

Install the latest version of the Slack CLI for your operating system:

- [Slack CLI for macOS & Linux](https://docs.slack.dev/tools/slack-cli/guides/installing-the-slack-cli-for-mac-and-linux/)
- [Slack CLI for Windows](https://docs.slack.dev/tools/slack-cli/guides/installing-the-slack-cli-for-windows/)

You'll also need to log in if this is your first time using the Slack CLI.

```sh
slack login
```

#### Initializing the project

```sh
slack create my-bolt-js-app --template slack-samples/bolt-js-starter-template
cd my-bolt-js-app
```

After cloning, you're all set to start developing!

<details><summary><strong>Using Terminal</strong></summary>

#### Create Your Slack App

1. Open [https://api.slack.com/apps/new](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) and choose "From an app manifest"
2. Choose the workspace you want to install the application to
3. Copy the contents of [manifest.json](./manifest.json) into the text box that says `*Paste your manifest code here*` (within the JSON tab) and click _Next_
4. Review the configuration and click _Create_
5. Click _Install to Workspace_ and _Allow_ on the screen that follows. You'll then be redirected to the App Configuration dashboard.

#### Environment Variables

Before you can run the app, you'll need to store some environment variables.

1. Rename `.env.sample` to `.env`
2. Open your apps configuration page from [this list](https://api.slack.com/apps), click _OAuth & Permissions_ in the left hand menu, then copy the _Bot User OAuth Token_ into your `.env` file under `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
3. Click _Basic Information_ from the left hand menu and follow the steps in the _App-Level Tokens_ section to create an app-level token with the `connections:write` scope. Copy that token into your `.env` as `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`.

#### Initializing the project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/slack-samples/bolt-js-starter-template.git my-bolt-js-app
cd my-bolt-js-app
```

#### Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Development

### Starting the app

#### Slack CLI

```sh
slack run
```

#### Terminal

```sh
npm start
```

### Linting

```zsh
# Run lint for code formatting and linting
npm run lint
```

### Testing

```zsh
# Run test for unit tests
npm test
```

## Project Structure

### `manifest.json`

`manifest.json` is a configuration for Slack apps. With a manifest, you can create an app with a pre-defined configuration, or adjust the configuration of an existing app.

### `app.js`

`app.js` is the entry point for the application and is the file you'll run to start the server. This project aims to keep this file as thin as possible, primarily using it as a way to route inbound requests.

### `/listeners`

Every incoming request is routed to a "listener". Inside this directory, we group each listener based on the Slack Platform feature used, so `/listeners/shortcuts` handles incoming [Shortcuts](https://docs.slack.dev/interactivity/implementing-shortcuts/) requests, `/listeners/views` handles [View submissions](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_submission) and so on.

## App Distribution / OAuth

Only implement OAuth if you plan to distribute your application across multiple workspaces. A separate `app-oauth.js` file can be found with relevant OAuth settings.

When using OAuth, Slack requires a public URL where it can send requests. In this template app, we've used [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/download). Checkout [this guide](https://ngrok.com/docs#getting-started-expose) for setting it up.

Start `ngrok` to access the app on an external network and create a redirect URL for OAuth.

```
ngrok http 3000
```

This output should include a forwarding address for `http` and `https` (we'll use `https`). It should look something like the following:

```
Forwarding   https://3cb89939.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000
```

Navigate to **OAuth & Permissions** in your app configuration and click **Add a Redirect URL**. The redirect URL should be set to your `ngrok` forwarding address with the `slack/oauth_redirect` path appended. For example:

```
https://3cb89939.ngrok.io/slack/oauth_redirect
```

## Make This Template a Code Assistant App

Take your exploration a step further and make this template an [AI app](https://tools.slack.dev/bolt-js/concepts/ai-apps) with the use of a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) model. Follow [this tutorial](https://tools.slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorials/code-assistant) to find out how.
