# `slack doctor`

Check and report on system and app information

## Synopsis

Check and report on relevant system (and sometimes app) dependencies

System dependencies can be reviewed from any directory
* This includes operating system information and Deno and Git versions

While app dependencies are only shown within a project directory
* This includes the Deno Slack SDK, API, and hooks versions of an app
* New versions will be listed if there are any updates available

Unfortunately, the doctor command cannot heal all problems

```
slack doctor [flags]
```
