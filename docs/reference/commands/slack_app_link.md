# `slack app link`

Add an existing app to the project

## Synopsis

Saves an existing app to a project to be available to other commands.

The provided App ID and Team ID are stored in the apps.json or apps.dev.json
files in the .slack directory of a project.

The environment option decides how an app is handled and where information
should be stored. Production apps should be 'deployed' while apps used for
testing and development should be considered 'local'.

Only one app can exist for each combination of Team ID and environment.
