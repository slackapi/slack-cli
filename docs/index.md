# Slack CLI

The Slack command-line interface (CLI) allows you to create and manage Slack apps from the command line. Use it in combination with the Deno Slack SDK, or the Bolt frameworks for JavaScript and Python.

Follow the installation guide for either [MacOS / Linux](/tools/slack-cli/guides/installing-the-slack-cli-for-mac-and-linux) or [Windows](/tools/slack-cli/guides/installing-the-slack-cli-for-windows) to get set up. Then, follow the the [Authorization guide](/tools/slack-cli/guides/authorizing-the-slack-cli) to connect your workspace.
