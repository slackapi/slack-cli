After modifying any file:
1. Use grep and/or search project index for the old feature name/variable names that were replaced
2. Check for references in documentation, comments, and test files
3. Look for any deprecated or unused code that can be safely removed or updated
4. Update all related tests to reflect the new implementation
5. Verify any usage examples in documentation are consistent with code changes
