After modifying any Go file:
1. Check for a corresponding _test.go file in the same directory
2. If found, inspect the test file to identify test cases related to your changes
3. Recommend any tests to add, update, or remove to cover the new implementation and behavior

When adding new flags or command options, be sure to add:
1. Tests for the flag parsing/presence in help text
2. Tests for the actual behavior when the flag is set or not set
